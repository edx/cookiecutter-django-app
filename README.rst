Cookiecutter Django Package
===========================

|travis-badge| |license-badge|

A cookiecutter_ template for creating reusable Django packages (installable apps) quickly.
If you're creating a standalone Django service, you should probably use
`cookiecutter-django-ida`_ instead.

**Why?** Creating reusable Django packages has always been annoying. There are no defined/maintained
best practices (especially for ``setup.py``), so you end up cutting and pasting hacky, poorly understood,
often legacy code from one project to the other. This template, inspired by `cookiecutter-djangopackage`_,
is designed to allow Django developers the ability to break free from cargo-cult configuration and follow
a common pattern dictated by the experts and maintained here.

.. _cookiecutter-pypackage: https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter-pypackage
.. _cookiecutter-djangopackage: https://github.com/pydanny/cookiecutter-djangopackage

Features
--------

* Sane setup.py for easy PyPI registration/distribution
* Travis-CI configuration
* Codecov configuration
* Tox configuration
* Sphinx Documentation
* AGPL licensed by default
* Basic model generation

Usage
-----

First, create your empty repo on Github (in our example below, we would call
it ``blogging_for_humans``) and set up your virtual environment with your
favorite method.  If you are an edX employee, request a new repo in the
``edx`` organization by submitting an ITSUPPORT ticket.  Details are in the
`How to request a new GitHub repo`_ wiki page. This ticket should also
request that Travis and Codecov be enabled for the new repository.

.. _How to request a new GitHub repo: https://openedx.atlassian.net/wiki/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=70385719

**Note**: Your project will be created with README.rst file containing a pypi
badge, a travis-ci badge and a link to documentation on readthedocs.org. You
don't need to have these accounts set up before using Cookiecutter or
cookiecutter-django-app.

Now, get Cookiecutter_. Trust me, it's awesome::

    $ pip install cookiecutter

Now run it against this repo::

    $ cookiecutter https://github.com/edx/cookiecutter-django-app.git

You'll be prompted for some questions, answer them, then it will create a directory that is your new package.

Let's pretend you want to create a reusable Django app called "Blogging-for-Humans", with an app that can be placed
in ``INSTALLED_APPS`` as "blogging_for_humans". Rather than have to copy/paste from other people's projects and
then fight enthusiasm-destroying app layout issues like `setup.py` configuration and creating test
harnesses, you get Cookiecutter_ to do all the work.

**Warning**: After this point, change 'John Doe', 'jdoe@edx.org', etc. to your own information.

It prompts you for information that it uses to create the app, with defaults in square brackets. Answer them::

    3 - Not open source
    Choose from 1, 2, 3 [1]:

Enter the project and take a look around::

    $ cd blogging_for_humans/
    $ ls

Generate a virtualenv and generate requirements files with dependencies
pinned to current versions (make sure you're using pip 9.0.2+ and Python 3.6)::

    $ mkvirtualenv Blogging-for-humans
    $ make upgrade

Create a GitHub repo and push it there::

    $ git init
    $ git add .
    $ git commit -m "first awesome commit"
    $ git remote add origin git@github.com:edx/blogging_for_humans.git
    $ git push -u origin master

Now take a look at your repo. Awesome, right?


Address TODOs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Look around in the new repo for sections marked `TODO`.  Here are a few known
places where they may appear:

* `openedx.yaml`: Various OEP states need to be updated.  See `OEP-2\: Repository Metadata`_ for more information.
* `{{cookiecutter.app_name}}/models.py`: If you specified any models to generate, the various docstrings need to be filled in, and PII annotations need to be added.  See `OEP-30\: PII Markup and Auditing`_ for more information on PII annotations.
* `tests/test_models.py`: Fill in docstrings here too.

.. _OEP-2\: Repository Metadata: https://open-edx-proposals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/oep-0002-bp-repo-metadata.html
.. _OEP-30\: PII Markup and Auditing: https://open-edx-proposals.readthedocs.io/en/latest/oep-0030-arch-pii-markup-and-auditing.html

Finally, it's time to write the code!!!


Running Tests
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Code has been written, but does it actually work? Let's find out!

::

    workon <YOURVIRTUALENV>
    (myenv) $ make requirements
    (myenv) $ make test-all


Github Checks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

On your first PR, ensure Travis and Codecov checks are running.

If Travis is not running, you can activate manually at https://travis-ci.org/edx/YOUR-REPO-NAME

If Codecov is not running, complete an ITSUPPORT ticket.

Register on PyPI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you have at least a prototype working and tests running, it's time to
register the application on PyPI.

If you are an edX employee,
`Open a Devops General Request ticket`_ to do this.  Simply ask for the Travis
encrypted password, specifying the new repository name. You can then follow
these instructions for `Publishing a Package to PyPI using Travis`_.

This avoids the need to distribute the password for the edx PyPI account too
widely.

If you are not an edX employee, you can follow the instructions in the Python
Packaging User Guide on `uploading your project to PyPI`_.

.. _Open a Devops General Request ticket: https://openedx.atlassian.net/servicedesk/customer/portal/3/create/36
.. _Publishing a Package to PyPI using Travis: https://openedx.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/OpenOPS/pages/41911049/Publishing+a+Package+to+PyPI+using+Travis
.. _uploading your project to PyPI: https://packaging.python.org/distributing/#uploading-your-project-to-pypi

Releasing on PyPI
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Time to release a new version? Update the version number in the application
module's ``__init__.py`` file, update ``CHANGELOG.rst`` accordingly, and run::

    $ python setup.py tag


Add to Django Packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once you have a release, and assuming you have an account there, just go to https://www.djangopackages.com/packages/add/ and add it there.
