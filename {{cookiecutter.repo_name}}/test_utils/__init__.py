Test utilities.

Since pytest discourages putting __init__.py into test directory (i.e. making tests a package)
one cannot import from anywhere under tests folder. However, some utility classes/methods might be useful
in multiple test modules (i.e. factoryboy factories, base test classes). So this package is the place to put them.
